Welcome to the docs page for **pyxalign**!

pyxalign is a python package for loading, aligning, and reconstructing 3D volumes for tomography or laminography datasets. pyxalign currently supports ptychography and x-ray flourescence (XRF) datasets.

To get started with pyxalign, try running an :doc:`example </examples/index>` and consult the :doc:`file loading documentation </api/io>` to learn how to load data from your beamline.

If you have any questions about pyxalign or if you would like me to add a data loader for your experiment, please email me at hruth@anl.gov.
